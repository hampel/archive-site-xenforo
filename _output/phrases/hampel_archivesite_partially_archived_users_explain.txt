Partially archived users have had their password removed by v1.x of this addon and were blocked from logging in to the site, however we didn't fully disable the accounts. In v2.x we go one step further and disable their accounts so archived users can no longer log in to the site using any authentication mechanism (passwords, connected accounts, passkeys, etc). If there are users listed below, you should consider running the <a href="{link}">Archive Users</a> process again to fully disable their accounts. Note that disabled users no longer appear in the Members list.
