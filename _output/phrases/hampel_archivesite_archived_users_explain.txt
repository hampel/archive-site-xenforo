Archived users have had their account disabled and can no longer log in to the site using any authentication mechanism (passwords, connected accounts, passkeys, etc). To un-archive an individual user, change their user_status to "valid", reset their password and then either promote them to super-admin status, or add them to the list of protected users in the config.php file.
